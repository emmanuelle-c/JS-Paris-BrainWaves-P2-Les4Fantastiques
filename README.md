# The Hero Experience
## Overview
The Hero Experience is a collaborative project developed by four web development students at the Wild Code School. Over the course of one month, we worked together to deliver a dynamic and engaging website using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. The website offers a unique service: renting the services of superheroes for various needs, such as schooling, moving out, or entertainment.
